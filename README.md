# odin-recipes

Hello reader,

This is a website I am creating with html basics I learned
through The Odin Project. The website consists of a few favorite 
recipes my wife makes! It serves to demonstrate a firm grasp of
html basics. The website is built with only a few files.
With the use of multiple elements like: head, body, image, anchor, lists, 
and several others, the website provides multiple pages. One for each 
recipe, with ingredients and instructions for how to prepare these home run
meals.
